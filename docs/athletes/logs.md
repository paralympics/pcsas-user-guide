# Logs
Interfaces that give a overview of pertinent changes that have made to athlete profiles or data.

## Career Log

Each change of an athlete’s career status is logged, as described in 
[Career & Name Changes](athletes/personal-data-or-registration.md#career-amp-name-changes). 

This additional grid summarises all career status changes for all athletes to get a 
better overview of: 
- the user that who made the update 
- the athlete that was updated

This might be useful for a detailed analysis or retirements and reactivations.

## File Access Log

Each time when any user of PCSAS opens or downloads a classification document from the
classification detail page of an athlete (see [Documentation](athletes/classification.md#documentation)) 
or generates a package with classification files for a major selection of athletes 
(see [Classification Files](reports/classification-files.md)), the access to these 
files are logged here.

The access log finally contains the information about which user identified by the 
username opened/downloaded which file (file ID and file category) for which athlete 
(ID, family and given name) at which exact time. This information is required to fulfil 
national obligations to prove and monitor the accesses to these files, especially in case 
of sensitive information like the medical documentation.

## Name Change Log

Each change of an athlete’s name is logged, as described in 
[Career & Name Changes](athletes/personal-data-or-registration.md#career-amp-name-changes). 
Any change of names is internally recorded, but only updates due to marriage/divorce (M) or 
nationality/NPC change (N) are listed.
This additional grid summarises these name changes for all athletes to get a 
better overview of:
- the user that who made the update 
- the athlete that was updated
